## Tree cleanup notice (2024-10-24)
I have pruned the tree of screenshots, essentially re-making the entire git history from scratch with anything from `misc/<year>` excluded. Any pull requests forking from the repository before 2024-10-24 contain an older version of the tree and will not be merged
