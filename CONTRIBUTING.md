# Contributing to Voxelius
## There is no documentation
That's it. The code is _supposed_ to be understandable and commented enough for a contributor to understand and improve it.  

### There actually is some
Dependency libraries, the language itself and stuff like that, however, have their own documentations for each specific version, so it would at least be appreciated if the contributors glanced through some of it.  

## How to contribute
1. Fork and clone the repository  
2. Write some code  
3. Build the project 
4. Test your own code  
5. Go to step 2 unless satisfied  
6. Push to your forked branch  
7. Make a pull request, optionally either find or create an issue to link the pull request with later  
8. Make changes if requested  
9. Enjoy your feature being merged later  

## But what about...?
When things come to other stuff that is not discussed or has a precedent from the past, I literally don't care ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
